      Social Science is a branch of study which deals with Human Beings – their behaviour, growth and development, relationships, resources they use and the various institutions they require to function and carry on their life smoothly. For example – family, school, workplace, government, judiciary, recreation clubs, etc. All these aspects of life are inter-related and interdependent on one another. So whether one wants to become a doctor or an engineer or a chartered accountant, an artist or a teacher, we all have to live in a society, interact with individuals belonging to different cultural and socio- economic backgrounds, adapt to various situations and circumstances, and also adhere to certain societal norms in order to lead a peaceful and productive life.
